I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Colorado State University (CSU) majoring in Watershed Science in the Department of Ecosystem Science and Sustainability. I received my Master's in Watershed Science from CSU in 2022. My research studies focus on post-fire hydrology, snow hydrology, streamflow modeling, and streamflow generation. My field experience includes installing stream sensors and developing stage-discharge rating curves; conducting snow surveys to measure SWE, density, and depth; and installing and managing meteorological stations. Sentence on data science skills.
